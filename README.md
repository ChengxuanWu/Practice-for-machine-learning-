Here us a repository for my own practice in machine learning, 
i try to learn all the mindset and workflow of ML from data preprocessing, data exploring and modeling. 
Because i just a beginner, if there's some deflicts, feel free to tell me !
If these code could help somebody begining to learning ML as me, it's my pleasure!
